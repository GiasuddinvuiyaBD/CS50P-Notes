## Creating Code with Python ✨

To write and run Python programs, you’ll need a code editor, which is sometimes referred to as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In this course, we’ll be using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, a popular and easy-to-use editor.

Before starting, make sure you have VS Code installed on your computer. Alternatively, you can use CS50's **Live VS Code Editor** for online coding.

In the editor:
- **Text editor** is where you write your code (at the top).
- **Terminal** is where you can execute commands (at the bottom).

### 📂 Creating a Python File

To create a new Python file, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
code hello.py
```

Here's what the command does:

- `code`: is the command that opens a file in VS Code.

- `hello`: is the name of the file.

- `.py`: is the file extension used for Python files.

Running this command will open a new Python file named `hello.py`, where you can start writing code.

### ✏️ Writing Your First Python Program
Now, in the text editor, write the following code:

```py
    print("hello, world")
```

Explanation: 
- `print`:  A built-in Python function that displays text on the screen.

- `"hello, world"`: This is the message that will be displayed when the program runs.

### 🚀 Running Your Python Program
In the terminal, type the following command and hit Enter:

```bash
    python hello.py
```
This command runs your hello.py file. To run any Python program, use the format:

```bash
python file_name.py
```

### 🧠 How It Works


Computers understand only binary (zeros and ones). When you run `python hello.py`, Python interprets your code and converts it into binary so the computer can execute it.


The result of running this command is:
```py
hello, world
```

The results of running the `python.py` program is `hello, world`. 

🎉 **Congrats!** You’ve just written and run your first Python program!

## Functions 🛠️

Functions are like actions (or verbs) that a computer or programming language already knows how to perform. 

They allow you to tell the computer what to do in a clear and efficient way.


For example, in your `hello.py` program, the `print()` function is designed to display text or output directly in the terminal window.
